# Church-Of-Iron

## Description
This project will become a fully functional gym web app that allows users to log in and create their own workout routine to 
track their progress by adding exercises from the default list or adding their own exercises to it. Each list will then be saved 
and stored for each individual user for future use. The user will also be able to copy their previous workouts to avoid typing it 
out each time.

## User Features
- Browse through the available exercise list that is divided into groups for each body part.
- Add own exercises to the app's default exercise list if they don't exist.
- Create a training log in which the user can add exercises and set the weight, reps, sets for each of them.
- Copy previous workouts to save time.

## Tech stack used for the project
- Back-end: Java.
