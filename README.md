# Church-Of-Iron

## Description
This project as of now is a work in progress to become a fully functional gym web app that allows users to log in to their accounts and create their own workout routines to track their progress. They can save exercises from the default list to their routine or add their own exercises to it. Each list will then be saved and stored for each individual user for future use. The user will also be able to copy their previous workouts with the previous reps and sets to avoid typing it out each time.

## User Features
- Browse through the available exercise list that is divided into groups for each body part.
- Add own exercises to the app's default exercise list if they don't exist.
- Create a training log in which the user can add exercises and set the weight, reps, sets for each of them.
- Copy previous workouts to save time.

## Tech stack used for the project
- Back-end: Java.
- Unit testing: Junit 5.
- Project build and management automation: Maven.

## Future features
- BMI calculation (in order to determine the users daily calorie intake to loss, gain or maintain weight),
- Add the ability for the user to change from the metric to imperial system.
- Log in to the app for personalized use.
- Save the user's training data for the next login session.
- Copy previous workouts to save time.
